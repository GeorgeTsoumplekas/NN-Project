# Neural_Networks_Project

This repository contains part of the assignments done for the Computational Intelligence class of ECE, AUTh. 

In the MLP file, you can find different MLP implementations that were trained and tested for classification on the MNIST dataset. 

In the RBF file, a simple RBF network is implemented and used in a regression problem using the Boston Housing dataset.
